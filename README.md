I'm Andrew and I loveeeee cute things ğŸ¥°ğŸ¥°ğŸ¥°ğŸ¥°ğŸ¥°ğŸ¥°ğŸ¥°ğŸ¥°ğŸ¥°, teaching, and creating things that make people happy!! I try to make everything I do fun.

Feel free to reach out to me at andrewwoan@gmail.com, my socials or schedule a meeting with me [here](https://calendly.com/andrewwoan/virtual-coffee-chat). I'm always looking for a new project to take on or down for a chat (tutoring, consulting, or something completely random unrelated to my work)!
