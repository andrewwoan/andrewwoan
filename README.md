# üçö Andrew Woan (ÁßëÂ••) üêº

Heyo üëã, thanks for stopping by! I am a developer that specializes on websites with 3D content. I often use [Three.js](https://threejs.org) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). I fell in love with creative development as it bridged my three passions of wanting to be a 3D artist, a game developer, and a web developer.

When I'm not doing those three things, I like to watch or do some other sort of art or craft (or you know, slacking off watching random YouTube videos or gaming). It's on my bucket list to try as many types of art and crafts as I can! I love exploration and all things creative.

Feel free to reach out to me at andrewwoan@gmail.com or my socials. I'm always looking for a new project to take on or down for a chat!
