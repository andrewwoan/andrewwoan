# 🍚 Andrew Woan (科奥) 🐼

Heyo 👋, I'm Andrew! I am a developer that specializes on websites with 3D content. I often use [Three.js](https://github.com/threejs) and [Blender](https://www.blender.org/). My life goal is to create things that make people happy.

When I'm not programming or 3D modeling, I like to do some sort of art or craft (like origami or graphic design). It's on my bucket 🪣 list to try as many types of art and crafts as I can before I get too old to do anything anymore! I love all things creative 🖊️.

Feel free to reach out to me at andrewwoan@gmail.com. I'm always looking for a new project to take on or open for a chat!
