# Andrew Woan

Heyo ðŸ‘‹, I'm Andrew! I am a developer that specializes on websites with 3D content. I often use [@threejs](https://github.com/threejs) and [@blender](https://www.blender.org/). My life goal is to create things that make people happy.

When I'm not developing or 3D modeling I like to do some sort of art or craft (both digital and physical). It's on my bucket list to try as many types of art and crafts as I can before I get too old.
