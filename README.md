# Andrew Woan

Heyo ðŸ‘‹, I'm Andrew! I am a developer that specializes on websites with 3D content. I often use [@threejs](https://github.com/threejs) and [@blender](https://www.blender.org/). My life goal is to create things that make people happy.

When I'm not developing or 3D modeling I like to do some sort of art or craft (both digital and in the real world). It's on my bucket list to try as many types of art and crafts as I can before I get too old to be able to not do anything anymore!
